            I am a self-taught web developer who codes both professionally and
            as a hobby. I mostly work with MERN, MEAN, and .NET. I share my work
            through social media, especially on my business Instagram account,
            where I showcase various projects.

          <p className="about-description">
            I started to code because I've always been interested in how coding
            and programs work. After starting with coding, I fell in love. I
            really enjoy the endless possibilities for creating new things.

          <p className="about-description">
            I started creating content on social media because I sought feedback
            from the community, but it quickly turned out that my content is
            really interesting for a lot of people. I liked the process of
            getting better and better, and that's why I still provide content to
            the community

          <p className="about-description">
            I love to create a simple and modern style. This portfolio is my
            jamâ€”simple, minimalistic, yet I feel satisfied with it. I also like
            to work on cyberpunk-like projects, but building this one was great.
